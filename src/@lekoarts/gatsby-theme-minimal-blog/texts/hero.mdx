I design and develop touchpoints where customers interact with our services, constantly striving to convey our ideas and values through the initial screens. I focus on UI/UX, user flow, performance tuning, and interactions to ensure a pleasant and intuitive user experience.

My goal is value-driven engineering, aiming to deliver the highest customer value and experience. I have a keen interest in beautiful UI and interactions, user-friendly UX, interface design, workflow automation, and cloud computing.

As a former industrial designer with international and domestic design awards, including the Red Dot Award, I bring a unique perspective to the intersection of design and technology.
